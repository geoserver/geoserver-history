REST Configuration API Reference
================================

Formats and representations
---------------------------

A ``format`` specifies how a resource should be represented. A format is used:

- In an operation to specify what representation should be returned to the 
  client
- In a POST or PUT operation to specify the representation being sent to the 
  server

In a GET operation the format can be specified in a number of ways. The first is
with the ``Accepts`` header. For instance setting the header to "text/xml" would
specify the desire to have the resource returned as XML. The second method of 
specifying the format is via file extension. For example consider the resource 
"foo". To request a representation of foo as XML the request uri would end with
"foo.xml". To request as JSON the request uri would end with "foo.json". When no
format is specified the server will use its own internal format, usually html.

In a POST or PUT operation the format specifies 1) the representatin of the 
content being sent to the server, and 2) the representation of the resposne to
be sent back. The former is specified with the ``Content-type`` header. To send
a representation in XML, the content type "text/xml" or "application/xml" would
be used. The latter is specified with the ``Accepts`` header as specified in the
above paragraph describing a GET operation.

The following table defines the ``Content-type`` values for each format: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Format
     - Content-type
   * - XML
     - application/xml
   * - JSON
     - application/json
   * - HTML
     - application/html
   * - SLD
     - application/vnd.ogc.sld+xml

Authentication
--------------

POST, PUT, and DELETE requests (requests that modify resources) require the 
client to be authenticated. Currently the only supported method of 
authentication is Basic authentication. See the 
:ref:`examples <rest_config_examples>` section for examples of how to perform 
authentication with various clients and environments.

Status codes
------------

A Http request uses a ``status code`` to relay the outcome of the request to the
client. Different status codes are used for various purposes through out this 
document. These codes are described in detail by the `http specification <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>`_.

Workspaces
----------

A ``workspace`` is a grouping of data stores. More commonly known as a 
namespace, it is commonly used to group data that is related in some way.

.. note::

   For GeoServer 1.x a workspace can be considered the equivalent of a
   namespace, and the two are kept in sync. For example, the namespace
   "topp, http://openplans.org/topp" corresponds to the workspace "topp".

Namespaces
----------

A ``namespace`` is a uniquely identifiable grouping of feature types. A
namespaces is identified by a prefix and a uri.

.. note::

   In GeoServer 1.7.x a namespace is used to group data stores, serving the 
   same purpose as a workspace. In 1.7.x the two are kept in sync. Therefore
   when adding a new namespace a workspace whose name matches the prefix of
   the namespace is implicitly created.

Data stores
-----------

A ``data store`` is a source of spatial data that is vector based. It can be a 
file in the case of a Shapefile, a database in the case of PostGIS, or a 
server in the case of a remote Web Feature Service.

.. _datastore_recurse:

The ``recurse`` parameter is used to recursively delete all feature types contained
by the specified data store. Allowable values for this parameter are "true" or  "false". 
The default value is "false".

``/workspaces/<ws>/datastores/<ds>/file[.<extension>]``
``/workspaces/<ws>/datastores/<ds>/url[.<extension>]``
``/workspaces/<ws>/datastores/<ds>/external[.<extension>]``

This operation uploads a file containing spatial data into an existing datastore, or 
creates a new datastore.

.. _extension_parameter:

The ``extension`` parameter specifies the type of data being uploaded. The following 
extensions are supported:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Extension
     - Datastore
   * - shp
     - Shapefile
   * - properties
     - Property file
   * - h2
     - H2 Database
   * - spatialite
     - SpatiaLite Database

The ``file``, ``url``, and ``external`` endpoints are used to specify the method that is 
used to upload the file. 

The ``file`` method is used to directly upload a file from a local source. The body of the request is the 
file itself.

The ``url`` method is used to indirectly upload a file from an remote source. The body of the request is
a url pointing to the file to upload. This url must be visible from the server. 

The ``external`` method is used to forgo upload and use an existing file on the server. The body of the 
request is the absolute path to the existing file.

- GET for a data store that is not file based -> 404

.. _datastore_file_put_notes:

When the file for a datastore are PUT, it can be as a standalone file, or as
a zipped archive. The standalone file method is only applicable to data stores 
that work from a single file, GML for example. Data stores like Shapefile 
must be sent as a zip archive.

When uploading a zip archive the ``Content-type`` should be set to
``application/zip``. When uploading a standalone file the content type should
be appropriately set based on the file type.

.. _configure_parameter:

The ``configure`` parameter is used to control how the data store is
configured upon file upload. It can take one of the three values "first",
"none", or "all".

- ``first`` - Only setup the first feature type available in the data store. This is the default.
- ``none`` - Do not configure any feature types.
- ``all`` - Configure all feature types.

.. _target_parameter:

The ``target`` parameter is used to control the type of datastore that is created
on the server when the datastore being PUT to does not exist. The allowable values
for this parameter are the same as for the :ref:`extension parameter <extension_parameter>`. 

.. _update_parameter:

The ``update`` parameter is used to control how existing data is handled when the 
file is PUT into a datastore that (a) already exists and (b) already contains a 
schema that matches the content of the file. It can take one of the two values 
"append", or "overwrite".

- ``append`` - Data being uploaded is appended to the existing data. This is the default.
- ``overwrite`` - Data being uploaded replaces any existing data.

Feature types
-------------

A ``feature type`` is a vector based spatial resource or data set that
originates from a data store. In some cases, like Shapefile, a feature type
has a one-to-one relationship with its data store. In other cases, like
PostGIS, the relationship of feature type to data store is many-to-one, with
each feature type corresponding to a table in the database.

- PUT that changes name of feature type -> 403
- PUT that changes data store of feature type -> 403

.. _featuretypes_post_notes:

When creating a new feature type via ``POST``, if no underlying dataset with the specified name exists an attempt will be made to create it. This will work only in cases where the underlying data format supports the creation of new types (such as a database). When creating a feature type in this manner the client should include all attribute information in 
the feature type representation.
 
.. _list_parameter:

The ``list`` parameter is used to control the category of feature types that 
are returned. It can take one of the three values "configured", "available", or "all".

- ``configured`` - Only setup or configured feature types are returned. This
  is the default value.
- ``available`` - Only unconfigured feature types (not yet setup) but are 
  available from the specified datastore  will be returned.
- ``available_with_geom`` - Same as ``available`` but only includes feature 
  types that have a geometry attribute.
- ``all`` - The union of ``configured`` and ``available``.

.. _featuretype_recurse:

The ``recurse`` parameter is used to recursively delete all layers that reference
by the specified feature type. Allowable values for this parameter are "true" or  
"false".  The default value is "false".

.. _featuretype_recalculate:

Some properties of feature types are automatically recalculated when necessary.
In particular, the native bounding box is recalculated when the projection or projection policy are changed, and the lat/lon bounding box is recalculated when the native bounding box is recalculated, or when a new native bounding box is explicitly provided in the request.
*The native and lat/lon bounding boxes are never automatically recalculated when they are explicitly included in the request.*
In addition, the client may explicitly request a fixed set of fields to calculate by including a comma-separated list of their names as a parameter named ``recalculate``.  For example:

   * ``recalculate=`` (empty parameter): Do not calculate any fields, regardless of the projection, projection policy, etc.
     This might be useful to avoid slow recalculation when operating against large datasets.
   * ``recalculate=nativebbox``: Recalculate the native boundingbox, do not recalculate the lat/lon bounding box.
   * ``recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox``: Recalculate both the native boundingbox and the lat/lon bounding box.

     -

*Exceptions*:

- GET for a data store that does not exist -> 404
- GET for a data store that is not file based -> 404

.. _coveragestore_file_put_notes:

When the file for a coveragestore is PUT, it can be as a standalone file, or
as a zipped archive. The standalone file method is only applicable to coverage
stores that work from a single file, GeoTIFF for example. Coverage stores like
Image moscaic must be sent as a zip archive.

When uploading a zip archive the ``Content-type`` should be set to
``application/zip``. When uploading a standalone file the content type should
be appropriately set based on the file type.

.. _coverageName_parameter:

The ``coverageName`` parameter is used to specify the name of the coverage
within the coverage store. This parameter is only relevant if the ``configure``
parameter is not equal to "none". If not specified the resulting coverage will
receive the same name as its containing coverage store.

.. note::

   Currently the relationship between a coverage store and a coverage is one to
   one. However there is currently work underway to support multi-dimensional
   coverages, so in the future this parameter is likely to change.

.. _coverage_recalculate:

Some properties of Coverages are automatically recalculated when necessary.
In particular, the native bounding box is recalculated when the projection or projection policy are changed, and the lat/lon bounding box is recalculated when the native bounding box is recalculated, or when a new native bounding box is explicitly provided in the request.
*The native and lat/lon bounding boxes are never automatically recalculated when they are explicitly included in the request.*
In addition, the client may explicitly request a fixed set of fields to calculate by including a comma-separated list of their names as a parameter named ``recalculate``.  For example:

   * ``recalculate=`` (empty parameter): Do not calculate any fields, regardless of the projection, projection policy, etc.
     This might be useful to avoid slow recalculation when operating against large datasets.
   * ``recalculate=nativebbox``: Recalculate the native boundingbox, do not recalculate the lat/lon bounding box.
   * ``recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox``: Recalculate both the native boundingbox and the lat/lon bounding box.


Coverages
---------

A ``coverage`` is a raster based data set which originates from a coverage 
store.

"false".  The default value is "false".

Styles
------

A ``style`` describes how a resource (feature type or coverage) should be 
symbolized or rendered by a Web Map Service. In GeoServer styles are 
specified with :ref:`SLD <styling>`.

.. _sld_post_put:

When POSTing or PUTing a style as SLD, the ``Content-type`` header should be
set to ``application/vnd.ogc.sld+xml``.

.. _name_parameter:

The ``name`` parameter specifies the name to be given to the style. This 
option is most useful when POSTing a style in SLD format, and an appropriate
name can be not be inferred from the SLD itself.

Layers
------

A ``layer`` is a *published* resource (feature type or coverage). 

.. note::

   In GeoServer 1.x a layer can considered the equivalent of a feature type or
   a coverage. In GeoServer 2.x, the two will be separate entities, with the 
   relationship from a feature type to a layer being one-to-many.

Configuration reloading 
----------------------- 

Reloads the catalog and configuration from disk. This operation is used to 
reload GeoServer in cases where an external tool has modified the on disk 
configuration. This operation will also force GeoServer to drop any internal 
caches and reconnect to all data stores.

``/reload``

Resource reset 
----------------------- 

Resets all store/raster/schema caches and starts fresh. This operation is used to 
force GeoServer to drop all caches and stores and reconnect fresh to each of them first time they 
are needed by a request.
This is useful in case the stores themselves cache some information about the data structures
they manage that changed in the meantime.
