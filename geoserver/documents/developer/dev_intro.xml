  <title>Introduction</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Welcome</title>

    <para>The GeoServer project is an integrated Java implementation of the
    1.0 Web Feature Server and 1.1.1 WMS specification from the <ulink
    url="http://www.opengis.org">OpenGIS</ulink> Consortium. GeoServer aspires
    to be the '<ulink url="http://www.apache.org">Apache</ulink>' of OpenGIS
    data serving and its mission is to enable greater geographic
    interoperability by reinforcing OpenGIS and other web standards and
    lowering the barriers to entry for geographic data providers. Developers
    should keep in mind the four primary goals of GeoServer, listed in order
    of importance:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Standards Compliance</emphasis>: The
        primary intent of the GeoServer project is to promote standardization
        and it must, therefore, adhere to published standards as closely as
        possible. GeoServer also attempts to support as many relevant
        geographic standards as possible.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Data Format Support</emphasis>: In order
        to make GeoServer a useful product, it must help translate the current
        cacaphony of geogaphic data formats into a single format. Therefore,
        supporting several data formats - both relational and flat files - is
        of primary importance to the project.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Ease of Use</emphasis>: GeoServer is
        targeted at organizations with minimal technical expertise and must,
        therefore, be easy to install, configure, and run for organizations
        with few technical resources.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Efficiency</emphasis>: Given that the
        volume of data required by geographic applications generally entails
        severe computational and bandwidth loads, GeoServer strives to be as
        efficient as possible, while achieving other goals.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The GeoServer Project strives to be as open as possible, making it
    easy for any one to join the community and contribute, and to have a say
    in the direction that GeoServer heads. We want GeoServer to be
    collaboratively built, so that it can effectively meet a variety of needs,
    hopefully leading to a world of more open technology and open spatial
    data. To that end much effort has been put into documentation, so that new
    developers can easily get their bearings. If there are questions that are
    not answered by this developer's guide, or other documentation on this
    site, please ask, it's the only way the developers can know what needs
    improvement.</para>

    <para>GeoServer has an active developer community that you can engage by
    joining the GeoServer mailing list and asking questions or making
    suggestions.</para>

    <title>Contributing</title>

    <para>Please see our <ulink url="../user/contributing.html">How to
    Help</ulink> page for lengthy information on contributing. It is mostly
    focused on non coding ways to help out, since things are a bit more
    obvious as a developer. </para>

    <para>Most of these developer docs are aimed directly at how developers
    can contribute. There are always tasks to be done, but we have found in
    the past that it's better to have a problem you would like to solve,
    rather than ask developers where you might help out. If you do want to
    just help out, it's best to have an idea of what kinds of tasks you are
    interested in. A good place to start to get a sense of what we are working
    on is our JIRA <ulink
    url="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10311">task
    tracker</ulink>. Or just ask the developers list. Generally the way to
    start is to find small improvements that can be made in the current code
    base, offering suggestions and patches, and moving from there into a full
    contributor as you start to figure out how all the pieces fit together.
    Our developers try to help you out in the learning process as much as
    possible, please don't hesitate to ask questions, and hopefully we can
    include the answers in future developers docs. We also highly encourage
    companies to spend some of their developers resources on expanding
    GeoServer's capabilities. In return for major work we are more than happy
    to put links on the main GeoServer site pointing users to commercial
    support offered by any company that contributes.</para>

    <title>A note on the license</title>

    <para>GeoServer is curently released under the <ulink
    url="license.html">Gnu Public License (GPL)</ulink>. None of our core
    contributors are fanatic about the GPL, it just seemed to be the best
    choice at the time, and we have not changed it since. We would like to say
    that the GPL is not anti-business, as many opponents like to make it out
    to be. Selling GeoServer is completely legal, as is offering commercial
    support on it. What it does is protects the rights of developers, by
    ensuring that no one can take the base of code and improve it without
    giving it back to those who laid the ground work. The main reason we like
    it because it keeps the community tighter, lets us know who else is
    working on GeoServer. If for some reason you would like to develop
    GeoServer, but your company is scared of the GPL, then please talk to the
    developers, as we can often come up with a good solution, releasing it
    under a different license to your company, for example. We don't care
    about all code being rolled back in, as the GPL stipulates, but we would
    like to know who else is working on GeoServer. So far we do not think the
    GPL license has held anyone up, perhaps due to the fact that GeoServer is
    a seperate enough piece of software that it does not affect others so
    much. But please let us know if the license does concern you. We are
    considering Apache or LGPL for GeoServer 2.0, as we are looking to make it
    more of a framework on top of which other web applications could
    hang.</para>
